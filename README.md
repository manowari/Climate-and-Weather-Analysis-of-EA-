Modelling weather and climate  behaviours is an extremely complicated affair that requires some domain specific knowledge that any data science

For that reason it's wiser to rely on Deep Learning and Some advanced data analysis to obtain hidden patterns that are invisible 
to routine analysis and the human eye. 

For beginners, to work around libraries you can use [this project as a guide](https://github.com/manowari/Routine-Python-Processes-for-my-Projects./blob/main/README.md)
